# Bolt AI React Voice Notes - Progress Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the work done to fix critical functionality issues in the Bolt AI React Voice Notes app, focusing on audio recording and playback functionality. It provides context for future development sessions without requiring conversation history.

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Audio Recording Functionality
- Fixed recording start failure by adding a check for `navigator.mediaDevices` before accessing `getUserMedia`
- Updated `recordingStore.ts` to handle environments where MediaDevices API is not available
- Removed dependency on deprecated routing store in `startRecordingFlow` function
- Fixed the record button visibility logic in `RecordScreen.tsx` (was incorrectly showing only when audio was playing)

### 2. Navigation and Routing
- Replaced all custom routing store usage with React Router hooks throughout the app
- Updated `RecordButton`, `LibraryScreen`, `NoteDetailScreen`, and `AgentsScreen` components to use React Router
- Created `NoteDetailScreenWrapper` component to fetch notes by URL param and handle missing notes gracefully
- Fixed navigation between screens and note details

### 3. Audio Playback
- Fixed audio initialization by adding `initializeAudio()` call when the app loads in `App.tsx`
- Ensured proper audio element setup and event handlers in `audioStore.ts`
- Fixed import paths in `PersistentAudioPlayer.tsx` and other components

### 4. Settings Screen
- Fixed infinite loop crash in Settings screen by:
  - Adding memoization for all settings components to prevent re-renders
  - Removing unnecessary shallow comparison in useSettingsStore hook
  - Using memoized component references in the settings groups structure

### 5. Import Path and Casing Fixes
- Corrected import paths in multiple components to use relative paths
- Fixed casing in layout folder imports to match the file system
- Removed unused imports causing lint warnings

## Known Issues and Remaining Tasks

### Critical Issues
1. **AI Agents Screen**: Still stubbed and needs real functionality implementation
2. **iOS Audio Playback**: May still have issues on iOS Safari/Chrome that need testing
3. **Audio Optimization**: Need to verify the audio optimization features work correctly on iOS

### Remaining Tasks
1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all fixed functionality:
   - Recording from Record screen
   - Playback in Library and Note Detail screens
   - Settings screen functionality
   - Navigation between all screens

2. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Ensure consistent UI behavior across all screens
   - Fix any remaining flickering or blinking issues in the Library screen
   - Verify responsive design works on mobile devices

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Review and optimize state management in Zustand stores
   - Ensure proper cleanup of audio resources
   - Address any memory leaks, especially for iOS devices

4. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Remove any remaining references to the deprecated routing store
   - Fix remaining lint warnings
   - Ensure consistent code style across the codebase

## Technical Context

### Key Components
- **App Structure**: React app with Vite as build tool
- **State Management**: Zustand stores for audio, recording, notes, settings
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Audio**: Web Audio API and MediaDevices API

### Important Files
- `src/stores/audioStore.ts`: Handles audio playback functionality
- `src/stores/recordingStore.ts`: Manages recording state and functionality
- `src/components/screens/RecordScreen.tsx`: Main recording interface
- `src/components/layout/PersistentAudioPlayer.tsx`: Global audio player component
- `src/components/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`: Settings interface with multiple sub-components

### Environment Requirements
- Recording requires secure context (localhost or HTTPS) for MediaDevices API
- iOS has specific requirements for audio handling and optimization

## Next Steps Recommendation
1. Complete the AI Agents screen implementation
2. Test all functionality on both desktop and mobile devices
3. Focus on iOS-specific optimizations for audio handling
4. Clean up any remaining code issues and lint warnings
