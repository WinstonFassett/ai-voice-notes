# Progress Report 3: NoteDetailScreen UX Improvements

## Completed Fixes

1. **Consolidated Takeaways Section**
   - Combined child notes and AI takeaways into a single "Takeaways" section
   - Added "Run AI Agents" button in the same row as the Takeaways header
   - Added fallback message when no takeaways exist

2. **Tag Clicking in LibraryScreen**
   - Fixed tag clicking in LibraryScreen to properly filter notes
   - Added proper event handling to prevent navigation when clicking tags

## Remaining Issues

1. **Markdown Formatting**
   - Need to ensure consistent markdown formatting for all note content in all places
   - Current implementation is missing proper markdown rendering in some note displays

2. **Vertical Spacing**
   - Missing proper vertical spacing between parent notes and their children in LibraryScreen

3. **Navigation Highlighting**
   - Library tab unhighlights when navigating to a note detail view
   - Need to maintain tab highlighting based on the navigation context

4. **Tag Consistency**
   - Tag clicking behavior is not consistent across all places where tags are displayed
   - Need to implement consistent tag handling throughout the app

5. **Duplicate Headers**
   - Some duplicate headers still exist in the NoteDetailScreen
   - Need to clean up remaining duplicate sections

## Next Steps

1. Fix markdown formatting for all note content displays
2. Add proper vertical spacing between parent and child notes
3. Fix navigation tab highlighting to maintain context
4. Implement consistent tag handling across all components
5. Remove any remaining duplicate headers or sections
6. Test all fixes thoroughly to ensure consistent UX
